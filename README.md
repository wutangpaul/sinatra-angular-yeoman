## What's in the box?

This is basically a Yeoman generated AngularJS app, riding on a Sinatra, with some additional goodies thrown in. I use it as a starter template for new projects. No Bootstrap, no jQuery, no resets. Plug your own in. 

* AngularJS with modular skeleton layout
* Yeoman
* Grunt
* Bower
* Live Reloading (with no browser extensions)
* Karma test framework
* Ruby Gems
* Sass
* Sinatra with Grunt Connect proxy passthrough
* FontAwesome Icons
